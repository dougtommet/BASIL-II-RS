# Create all rater pairs

The BASIL RS data was transformed so that all of the unique rater pairs are created. There are seven raters so that results in 21 (6+5+4+3+2+1) unique pairs per participant. With 46 participants, if there were no missing data, this would be 21 \* 46 = 966 pairs. One rater missed two participants so there are only 954 pairs.

In the resulting data file the raters were assigned the following ids.
